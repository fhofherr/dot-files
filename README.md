# dot-files

This repository contains the configuration files of many tools I use. It
may not be useful to you at all, or you may be able to re-use parts of
it. I host those files on GitHub to have them available whenever I need
to setup a new environment to work with.

The repository contains an automated installation procedure. To install
all of the configuration files execute:

```bash
./install.zsh
```

The installation script assumes that the necessary programs are
installed and available on the path.
